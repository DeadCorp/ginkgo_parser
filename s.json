Chromebook starts up in seconds, so you can immediately start playing or working. Chromebook looks like a laptop and feels like a laptop, but differs from traditional computers as follows:    Instead of Windows OS or Apple OS, Chromebook PCs run on Chrome OS, an operating system that features multiple layers of security, cloud storage and the most popular Google products built right in. Chromebook won't load and run traditional PC applications such as Microsoft Office or Skype. However, Chromebook uses Chrome-specific apps for everyday tasks. You'll be able to create documents, listen to music, edit your photos, chat with friends and family and play online games. Plus, you can download many additional apps from the Chrome Web Store. No more buying and installing software Ã¢ÂÂ thousands of apps are free and feature automatic updates. Chromebook comes with built-in virus protection, multiple layers of security and verified boot help to keep you safe from viruses and malware. Your Chromebook will keep your files away from your machine and safe online. Google Drive is built right in, so your files and photos are automatically backed up to the cloud. Your Chromebook will update itself for free, so you'll always have the latest and greatest version. No need for manual downloads and upgrades.  ",

Tablet PCs are compact, ultra-portable entertainment devices that let you read email, surf the Internet, read eBooks, view photos, play games, listen to music and watch video files. Most tablets are based on a smaller operating system, which allows you to purchase and download additional applications from supported stores. Tablet PCs do not have a CD/DVD drive and will not run Microsoft Windows or its applications. Tablet PCs function as a secondary device for casual entertainment purposes and are not meant to replace a computer. They are ideal for use around the home and on the go with WiFi or 3-4G mobile broadband connections (pay as you go, contract may be required for service).",
